# hello-world
First master branch in GitHub.

Hello, everyone! 

I am Tairan, a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student major in Control Theory and its applications.

Some times, I also do some other projects in other areas.

I have widely spread interest areas.

About 6 years ago, I was doing something about Experimental Fluid Mechanics. 

About 1.5 years ago, I was doing something about Remote Sensing applications in Agriculture.

About 1 years ago, I was doing some Computational Chemistry projects.

And now, I am doing some mechanical control applications.

There are so many possibilities in our life, but just embrace it and enjoy it.


Thanks!
